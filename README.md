# Friend Match

### Summary
Friend match is essentially a small dating service game with the theme of the office. It takes users inputs and matches them with the most appropriate employee from the TV show. 

### The goal of this project
To demonstrate how one would build a match system based on values from an array of "people" objects and their assigned values. 

### File Structure
The site is built as a series of inputs, which are then added up and matched to the closest employee. The employees are stored in a .js file as objects with names, images, and an array of numbers assigned as values for certain traits.

### Instructions
Upon loading the main page, the user can click the "take quiz now" button to be taken to the list of questions which will qualify them for a match. Once a user completes all the questions, the code will take into account the values input by the user and match them with the "best" employee for them.

### Future of this project
I would like to sometime add more questions or make this more thorough just for proof of concept, and of course polish the UI.
